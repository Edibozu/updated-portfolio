              My name is Eduardo Pineda, and live in Augusta, GA with my
              girlfriend, and our two cats, Cocoa & Pepe. I enjoy watching
              sports(basketball & football), playing video games, traveling,
              learning new skills, and trying as many foods as i possibly can.
              Currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's Coding Boot Camp, with the
              hopes of becoming a full-stack web developer. Decided to pursue
              this path after not finding my calling while working in many
              dirrent fields, which include: construction, retail, customer
              service, management, and public service. Previous job experience
              shows my versatility and adaptability to changing environments and
              situations.

              While still in the process of completing my program, I'm doing
              everything in my power, to learn as much as possible, about Front
              and Back End Developement. Placing full confidence in myself to be
              successful in my future endeavors. Provided is my porfolio,
              showing a number of assignments that have kept me quite busy and
              show my progress as a student. Please check out my Contact Page,
              which provies my contact information and numerous links.
